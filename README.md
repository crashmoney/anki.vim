# anki.vim

A lightweight syntax-highlight plugin for writing Anki flashcards in plain-text files

- recognizes the file extension `.anki.txt`
- compatible with both Vim and NeoVim

## Syntax Notes

- assumes HTML usage for card formatting (e.g. `<b>bold text</b>`, `<br>` for line breaks)
- each line corresponds to one card
- comments are preceded by a hash (e.g. `# a comment here`)
- card reverses are marked by colons (e.g. `front of card?:back of card`)

## Installation

### using lazy.nvim
